# What?
This folder contains example solutions for various worlds/problems.

# How?
To use/try them, either compile them directily in their folder or copy them to your normal folder where your `karel.h` lies. **Important:** you have to change the top line from `#include "../../karel.h"` to `#include "karel.h"`, depending on where this file is, relative to the `karel.h`.

# Please
dont just copy the code, but rather try to understand and learn it.
thanks :>
